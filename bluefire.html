                    <h2>‘Blue Fire’ reignites 3D platformer genre</h2>
                    <h6>Feb 25, 2021</h6>
                     <br>
 <p>                   
After clearing the first few challenges in “Blue Fire,” I had built a sense of confidence that I’d begun to master the simple mechanics presented to me. Jump here, dodge there, don’t fall into the occasional abyss and ward off any enemies. However, after dying more times than I’d like to admit in my 12-hour playthrough, I can confirm “Blue Fire” demands much more skill and patience for true success. </p>

 <p> 
“Blue Fire'' is set in the mysterious world of Penumbra, and to its favor, embraces unlikely influences from outside its genre. Players will recognize aesthetic similarities with “The Legend of Zelda'' franchise and a respawn system inspired by the popular “Dark Souls.” Even with those comparisons, the game manages to establish its own identity through evolving level design and subtle narrative. </p>
 <p> 
Early on, the player will experience a predominantly linear map with the occasional open room that hints at the possibility of more. The main challenge is how to get from one place to another. The player will traverse through platform-based levels while completing puzzles and fighting enemies who cause more pain than good if not taken seriously.</p>
 <p> 
In between traveling and fighting, the player will find shrines, which act as save and respawn locations for when death ultimately occurs, and statues that transcend them to Void Levels. These levels focus purely on fast-paced platforming and reward players with an additional heart if completed. </p>
 <p> 
I appreciated the warmup “Blue Fire” gave me in these opening moments. It allowed room for me to grow accustomed to the physics and nature of the game before revealing the rest of its hand. It was around a quarter of the way into my playthrough when the focus of the level design altered and my quest to save the gods of Penumbra began.</p>
 <p> 
It started with the exploration of dungeon-like temples and open areas that left me wondering which direction to go. My curious habits of wandering about were always met with new interactions, valuable items and undiscovered Void levels. It’s during this time that I fell in love with “Blue Fire’s” old school approach. It demanded attention to the minute details to reach maximum progression and satisfaction for each temple. </p>
 <p> 
It’s also worthy to note that these temples are undeniably inspired by the likes of “The Legend of Zelda.” I never felt the similarities hindered any aspect of the game, and if anything, it brought me joy to be reminded of the days playing “The Wind Waker” on my GameCube.</p>
 <p> 
Later on, the focus shifts once again, having the player fight more bosses while re-exploring already introduced locations. This particular transition might be jarring for some players, but I found it quite enjoyable and on theme with the already dynamic gameplay.</p> 
 <p> 
Continuing with the expedition, players will gain access to new abilities that allow room for the environmental challenges to develop alongside the story. I won’t spoil too many of them, but one example that’s gifted early on is the skill to run alongside walls. It might not seem like much, but “Blue Fire'' uses the addition of this simple mechanic, and many others, to add another layer of strategy to an already unique formula. </p>
 <p> 
There’s also a small number of side quests to be accepted. These missions, which are collected from the strange patrons found in abandoned towns and grotesque sewers, build upon the narrative of Penumbra. Each quest can be completed rather easily and offers specific items that are otherwise not available.</p>
 <p> 
Items can include new weapons, tunics or helpful materials that can be sold for money. Players will need the extra cash to gain access to shrines and certain locations throughout the world. If the player happens to die along the way, all collected money will remain in that area until the player reunites with their soul. Die before that, and all money is lost. </p>
 <p> 
This is the only area of “Blue Fire” where I ran into some frustrating moments. The game’s naturally difficult, but it can become a problem when bugs enter the picture. For example, I’d just completed the first temple and secured 5,999 coins in my newly upgraded pouch. I traveled toward a specific non-playable character (NPC) to repay a debt. While traveling, I made a risky jump and quickly dashed to safety. When I landed, my character froze and started to receive fall damage. That damage repeated until I lost all my health. </p>
 <p> 
I had 10 hearts at the time, and receiving fall damage normally equates to losing two. Once I returned to the spot where I’d fallen, my soul was nowhere to be seen. I lost all 5,999 coins to a bug that quickly changed my upbeat attitude to an angry and defeated one. It wasn’t the end of the world, and I didn’t encounter many other bugs after that, but it served as a warning that these moments could happen. </p>
 <p> 
“Blue Fire” is an exceptional 3D platformer. Its gameplay isn’t afraid to change on a whim, and it constantly challenges players to forget the tendencies made commonplace by modern titles. The platforming is addictive and the journey is short, but it only burns brighter the further the player dives in. </p>
