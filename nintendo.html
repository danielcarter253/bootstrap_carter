              <h2>Nintendo Direct reveals ‘Mario Golf,’ ‘Skyward Sword HD’</h2>
                    <h6>Feb 21, 2020</h6>
                     <br>
<p>
This past week, Nintendo held its first full Nintendo Direct in almost two years. The conference went over Nintendo’s plans for the first half of 2021 and announced several new titles coming to the Switch. These included “Mario Golf: Super Rush,” an HD remaster of “The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword” and “Star Wars Hunters.”</p>
<p>
First, “Mario Golf: Super Rush.” The upcoming entry will be made available June 21 and features new gameplay options the series hasn’t seen before. In the mode “Speed Golf,” players can use classic “Mario” power-ups to wipe out competition as they progress through the course. “Super Rush” will also support motion controls as well as the normal Joycon setup for its friendly matches.</p>
<p>
Next up is the highly anticipated, and very brief, conversation on “Breath of the Wild 2.” Fans were informed that developers were hard at work on the project but that they’d have to wait a little longer for concrete details on the game. Nintendo followed up with the reveal of “The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD” edition. The game is set to launch July 16 and will release alongside the newly themed “Skyward Sword” Joycons.</p>
<p>
If neither of those titles satisfied players' excitement for 2021, then perhaps the next addition to the “Splatoon” series will fill the void. “Splatoon 3” was announced for sometime next year and seems to build upon the fast-paced multiplayer that has been the staple of the series. Players will continue to use paint as the driving force to fight off other opponents, as Nintendo’s popular third-person shooter returns. </p>
<p>
“Star Wars'' enthusiasts will be excited to hear the Switch is receiving an exclusive experience with the release of “Star Wars Hunters.” It’s a new free-to-play multiplayer game created by developers Zynga. “Hunters” didn’t showcase any gameplay but was confirmed to release later this year. </p>
<p>
The last major title to be covered was “Project Triangle Strategy.” Unlike its predecessor “Octopath Traveler,” “Triangle Strategy” is a tactical role-playing experience more similar to the likes of “Fire Emblem.” The game is set to release in 2022 with more information, and perhaps a name change, in the near future.</p> 
<p>
In between the big moments, the conference spotlighted several existing games coming to the Nintendo eShop. The “Outer Wilds” will release later this year, “Tales of the Borderlands” will be available March 23, “Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville” on March 19 and the renowned “Fall Guys” sometime this summer. </p>
<p>
Alongside the new games, Nintendo unveiled the next fighter coming to the “Super Smash Bros Ultimate” library. Pyra and Myrtha from “Xenoblade Chronicles 2” will now be available with the purchase of the second fighter pass. The characters have the ability to swap forms mid-combat, and rely on their swords to deal out most of the damage. This now totals “Ultimate’s” roster to 87 characters, leaving fans to debate who’ll fill the last two slots. </p>
<p>
That covers it for all the major news and games revealed at Nintendo’s 2021 Direct. The conference offered plenty of content to look forward to, and even if some rumored titles weren't mentioned, one can only assume Nintendo will deliver more information to its fans sooner than later. </p>
