                <p>With Halloween weekend still upon us, there isn’t a better time to relive the scariest horror games of the decade. Whether it be hiding from cannibals after crash landing on an island, repeatedly walking down the same unnerving hallway or being trapped on a space station with a ravenous alien, the games below provide players with the most spine-chilling Halloween experiences. </p>

<h4>“Outlast”</h4>
 <p>                   
“Outlast” is a first-person survival-horror game that follows an all-too-curious journalist who finds himself exploring an abandoned psychiatric hospital. Accompanying him on this eerie journey is his trusty camcorder, but besides that, the player will find little to no other items that may help them on their playthrough. Instead of fighting enemies, “Outlast” focuses on stealth and solving puzzles to advance through the areas of the game. This creates a truly horrific experience as the player is genuinely helpless when it comes to protecting themselves. </p>
<p>
The psychiatric hospital consists of dark hallways, tight spaces, flickering lights, just enough batteries to keep the camera going and a bunch of crazy patients that’ve been there for far too long. “Outlast” clearly takes influence from classics like “Resident Evil” but maintains its own identity while displaying some new and interesting takes on the genre. </p>

<h4>“The Forest”</h4>
<p>
“The Forest” is another survival-horror game that can be played solo or with a group of friends. Instead of exploring a psychiatric hospital, the player(s) crash land on an unmarked island and must figure out a way to survive. The island is inhabited by a strange group of locals. By strange group, I mean, naked, screaming, multi-limbed creatures that have their newborn babies attack players in groups of hundreds. It’s absolutely bizarre, but “The Forest” is entertaining and dense with content. </p>
<p>
During the day, the player must collect essential items like wood for a fire or cloth and bones for a spear. At night, they must endure the horrors that appear out in the woods. The enemies begin to grow in numbers and change in strategy the longer the player survives. I’ll never forget watching the creatures slowly surround my camp on one lonely night. I watched carefully from inside my walls as they observed my nightly habits, but ultimately dispersed without attacking. The next night, a full onslaught proceeded as they tore down my camp and ended my hopes of surviving another day. </p>

<h4>“Resident Evil 7: Biohazard”</h4>
<p>
“Resident Evil 7” was published by Capcom in 2017 and sparked comparisons to the original releases in the franchise. Players no longer aim slowly over the shoulder with the third-person perspective that “Resident Evil 5” and “Resident Evil 6” are known for. Instead, this new first-person installment combines the recent direction of the genre with survival elements that made the series popular years ago. </p>
<p>
The story begins with the main character searching for an abducted loved one, which eventually leads them to explore various areas of a family’s estate. Of course, it’s “Resident Evil,” so expect plenty of gore, puzzles, crafting and monstrous creatures to appear. If one’s looking for an even more frightening experience, “Resident Evil 7” is also available for virtual reality. </p>

<h4>“Alien Isolation”</h4>
<p>
“Alien Isolation” takes the premise of what made “Outlast” a huge success and transfers it into a AAA title that takes place in the world of “Aliens.” Players will be trapped on a space station and hunted down by one single alien as it crawls around the air ducts and gutters to get the jump on Ripley. I’ve never experienced the constant stress and horror of knowing there’s something continuously hunting me down no matter what I do. Even after knowing my predicament, “Isolation” kept surprising me with new elements that still scare me to this day. </p>

<h4>“P.T.” </h4>
<p>
The story of “P.T.” is infamous. It was released by Kojima Productions in 2014 as a playable teaser for the next installment of the “Silent Hill” series. Director Hideo Kojima worked with filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro and actor Norman Reedus to create what would become the most well-known video game teaser of the decade and perhaps of all time. However, Konami — the producer of the game — had a very public and messy breakup with longtime developer Kojima. This was the catalyst for “Silent Hill’s” cancellation and “P.T.’s” removal from stores, but ultimately, the creation of a horror game legend. </p>
<p>
“P.T.” was a first-person horror game that played in a loop. Players would walk down the same L-shaped hallway only to open the door at the end and return back to where they started. With every walk, something would change about the hallway. Perhaps it was the lighting, a baby crying in the background, a fridge strangely hanging from the ceiling or maybe nothing at all. It presented puzzles for the player to figure out, even if they didn’t realize it in the moment, while maintaining the tense and dreadful feeling of being trapped in a haunted hallway. Even though players can no longer download this title, it’s easily cemented itself as one of the most critically acclaimed horror games to release in the past decade. </p>
<p>
The last 10 years have been a great representation of what the horror genre can produce and how it can change over time. As the Halloween celebrations end, don’t miss out on the opportunity to enjoy some of the greatest horror games of the decade.
