                    <h2>‘Final Fantasy VII Remake’ paves way for future remakes</h2>
                    <h6>May 6, 2020</h6>
                     <br>
<p>                  
It’s been 23 years since the debut of Cloud Strife in the release of “Final Fantasy VII” by developer Square Enix. In that time, Square Enix adjusted to the art of real-time combat and implemented it seamlessly into the newly animated world of Midgar. This mechanical city and its cast of eco-terrorists deliver an emotional story, backed up by plenty of side quests and a combat system that kept surprising me the further I dove into the campaign. </p>
<p>   
It’s important to note that this review is coming from the standpoint of one who never played the original “Final Fantasy VII,” but was introduced to the series through the prequel, “Final Fantasy Crisis Core.” </p>
<p>  
The narrative of the remake barely covers the original story crafted in 1997. Instead, Square Enix made the decision to release the game in different installments, giving them the chance to expand upon the diverse cast introduced in the original version. This choice results in an engrossing story that made me second guess every decision my characters made. They walked a tight line between saviors of their planet and a group of terrorists that threatened to destroy life in Midgar. </p>
<p>  
The protagonist, Cloud, starts off as a quiet man only focused on making money and supporting himself. However, when he’s reintroduced to an old friend, Tifa, he’s brought into the eco-terrorist group known as Avalanche. Avalanche and its cast of heroes — Barrett, Jessie, Wedge and Biggs — are the heart and soul of “Final Fantasy VII Remake,” and I got to witness the growing bonds between these characters in my 45-hour playthrough. </p>
<p>  
The story is divided into 18 chapters, and occasionally between certain chapters the player has options to complete side quests, engage in mini-games and traverse the beautiful landscape of Midgar. These moments were perfectly layered throughout the chapters. I never minded taking a quick break from the intense narrative to enjoy a casual, but insanely hard, pull-up mini game or an eccentric dance-off in Wall Market. </p>
<p>  
By the end, I felt a genuine bond with each member of the group as their journey to stop Shinra — the company in charge of Midgar — came to a close. The story’s overall direction can be a bit vague at times, as Cloud himself ignores many of the issues he faces regarding his past, and players who have no background knowledge on the events of the original game may find themselves confused. </p>
<p>  
This is something that won’t be cleared up for new players until the next entry, but since the events of the “Final Fantasy VII” have already been set in stone it's hard to fault Square Enix for not fitting everything into the first remake. The story may not be clear at times, but the constantly growing dynamic between the cast in “Final Fantasy VII” makes up for it. </p>
<p>  
The combat, on the other hand, may look familiar to old fans of the series. Players still cast iconic spells that appear in the original, and many famous weapons — such as the Buster Sword — make their return. The remake drops the old turn-based combat for a new real-time combat system.</p>
<p>  
The best way to describe the new style is if “Final Fantasy XV” and “Kingdom Hearts” had a love child. The player, depending on the scenario, switches between battling with a party of one, two or three characters. Each character has unique abilities based on their current weapon and can spend skill points toward each specific weapon, adjusting its style of play.</p>
<p>  
The player has the ability to unlock new weapons, materia — magic-based abilities — and equipment for each of the four playable characters. Collecting these items are enjoyable but can overwhelm the player with the sheer amount of options at their disposal. Each weapon has its own skill tree and each character can have around six weapons. This occasionally got in the way of the story, as I had to constantly go back to upgrade my characters at the end of every battle or cutscene. That being said, once I understood the flow of combat more, it became easier to know exactly how to build my squad to my liking.</p>
<p>  
The vast amount of options also come in handy towards the second half of the game. The enemies the player encounters increase in amount and difficulty. Each enemy is resistant and weak to different kinds of spells, specific abilities and physical attacks. This kept battles refreshing and challenging, while encouraging me to switch character loadouts in between fights. Every time I died, I knew it was because I didn’t properly prepare for my enemy and that I needed to either change my current materia or reset my weapon’s skill points. </p>
<p>  
“Final Fantasy VII Remake” does almost everything right. It tells a compelling story while developing every one of its characters thoroughly and wraps itself up nicely with combat mechanics and skill trees that provide the player with hours and hours of content. The direction of the narrative can be difficult to interpret, but Square Enix has started this new trend of remasters and remakes on the right foot.  </p>
